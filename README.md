## Introduction

"I'm Ettore De Rossi, private detective. I work for an investigative agency called Secret".

I like to make short trips whenever I can get some day off, and this time I decided to go in Turin. Unfortunately, the weather is very bad, with big visibility problems. As a precaution, at nightfall I decided to spend the night in a small hotel in the countryside just out of the city. Tomorrow morning I will get back to my journey...

"My room is not the best, but it's just for tonight ..."

22:30 pm - January 16:

During the night, between the roar of lightnings, a thud, as if something had fallen on the floor. But the detective is too exhausted and keeps sleeping, without noticing anything.

9.00 - January 17:

Someone is knocking on the door, we open the door...

It's a hotel agent...

"Good morning, I'm part of the hotel security staff. I wanted to inform you that because of the murder happened last night in one of the rooms, we are retaining all the customers until the arrival of the police for questioning. If you have any special needs, please ask to the manager of the Hall. Goodbye"
